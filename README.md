# Tora Project

Welcome to Tora Project - my web application that displays basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript that requests data from an API!

## Description

For my API URL I used: " https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos" and they gave off data that randomly gave me Latin Phrases that are randomly generated in a JSON file to show off the power of transferring data from one site off to another!
