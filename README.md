# Tora Project

Welcome to Tora Project - my web application that displays HTML, CSS, and Javascript that uses the fetch() command to request data from a local API database. 
## Description

For my API URL I used: " https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/" . When the "Fetch Data" button is clicked, it will trigger the API request, and once the data is retrieved successfully, it will be displayed within the container div.
